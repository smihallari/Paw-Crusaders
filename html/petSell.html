    Hello, I am Stefano Mihallari and this is one of the pages I worked on for my website. I have chosento pursue the  Computer Science route in University of York 
because I am passionte and enjoy doing it, namely discovering problems, figuring solutions out and then coding them.As a student I always aim to better myself and arm myself with
sharper weapons regarding the coding world.What I want to do in CS lies unsolved between Cybersecurity and Data Science.Outside of school, my hobbies lie in both playing
and watching the gaming world,particularly FPS games such as Counter Strike(https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2) and I also enjoy playing football, the team I support is 
Real Madrid(https://www.realmadrid.com/en-US). Whether it is coding late into the night while enjoying home-cooked meals next to a fireplace, or the excitement within me when my team
wins a match, I have tried to showcase it through my work in the website. Creating a pet adopting website as a means to help our friends in need employs both my self-reflection
as a person and hopefully a sweet glimpse at the beggining of my journey as a programmer. Feel free to dabble with anything you like :)

            <p>Our community  values genuine companionship, where pets are considered cherished family members rather than commodities. We firmly reject the practice of pet selling, advocating instead for a culture of responsible pet ownership.
                <br>
                We prioritize the well-being of animals, staunchly opposing practices that compromise their health and happiness. By firmly standing against pet selling, our vision is rooted in creating a world where every pet is treated with the kindness and respect they deserve.
                <br>
                Abolishing pet selling is a crucial step in addressing the challenge of overpopulation, working to reduce the surplus of pets in shelters and consequently minimizing euthanasia.
                <br>
                In celebrating responsible pet ownership, we applaud those individuals who embrace the commitment that comes with bringing a pet into their lives. Our community encourages thoughtful choices that prioritize the long-term well-being and happiness of these beloved companions. Welcome to a space where responsible pet ownership is championed, and every furry friend is valued as an integral part of our families.
