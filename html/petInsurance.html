    Hello, my name is Emiliano Sotir, I am first year student at the Computer
    Science Deprtament and I have created some web pages for our group 
    project(creating a website).In my top 3 qualities I’d mention being 
    caring,positive,compassionate especially about the degree that I have choosen. 
    I enjoy coding,creating web pages, solving problems. Wanting to see myself
    better and evolving is what keeps me going. Outside of school,
    I love cycling in the nature, playing chess and travelling. That’s why I choose
    CS, because I can work from anywhere that I want. In everything that I do,
    I try to leave a mark of myself, a thing that represents me and my style which
    is also included in this webpage related to pets. I know this is just a small 
    piece of the puzzle that is waiting for me ,but I’m excited for more.

                        WHAT IS PET INSURANCE?

                    </h3>
                    <h4>
                        Let us help you understand the concept of pet insurance

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Pet insurance is a valuable financial tool designed to provide pet owners
                        with peace of mind and financial security when it comes to their furry 
                        companions' healthcare needs. Just like health insurance for humans, pet
                        insurance helps cover veterinary expenses, ensuring that the cost of 
                        unexpected illnesses, accidents, or routine preventive care doesn't become
                        a burden. With a variety of plans available, pet insurance typically reimburses
                        a percentage of eligible veterinary bills, including surgeries, medications,
                        diagnostic tests, and even emergency treatments. This allows pet owners to
                        prioritize their pets' well-being without facing the dilemma of choosing between 
                        their beloved animal's health and their budget. Whether it's a mischievous puppy, 
                        a senior cat, or any other pet in between, having pet insurance provides an added 
                        layer of protection and fosters a stronger bond between pets and their owners by
                        ensuring that optimal healthcare is always within reach.

                        PURPOSE OF PET INSURANCE

                    </h3>
                    <h4>
                       We want to make this clear for you 
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        
                    The purpose of pet insurance is to safeguard the well-being of our cherished animal
                    companions by alleviating the financial strain associated with veterinary care. It
                    serves as a crucial resource for pet owners who want to ensure that their pets 
                    receive the best possible medical attention without compromising on quality due to 
                    cost concerns. Pet insurance plans are designed to cover a range of expenses, including 
                    veterinary visits, surgeries, medications, and emergency treatments, helping pet parents
                    manage unforeseen health issues. By providing financial support, pet insurance promotes
                    responsible pet ownership, encouraging regular veterinary check-ups and preventive care. 
                    Ultimately, the purpose of pet insurance is to empower pet owners to make decisions based
                    on their pets' health needs rather than financial constraints, fostering a happier,
                    healthier, and more secure bond between pets and their human companions.
